# Problem 1

## Load and clean data

Load data using `read_csv` and changed columns `babysex`, `frace`,
`malform`, and `mrace` as factor vectors.

``` r
birth_weight =
  read_csv("data/birthweight.csv") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  mutate_at(c("babysex", "frace", "malform", "mrace"), as.factor)
```

    ## Rows: 4342 Columns: 20

    ## -- Column specification --------------------------------------------------------
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## dbl (20): babysex, bhead, blength, bwt, delwt, fincome, frace, gaweeks, malf...

    ## 
    ## i Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## i Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

``` r
summary(is.na(birth_weight))
```

    ##   babysex          bhead          blength           bwt         
    ##  Mode :logical   Mode :logical   Mode :logical   Mode :logical  
    ##  FALSE:4342      FALSE:4342      FALSE:4342      FALSE:4342     
    ##    delwt          fincome          frace          gaweeks       
    ##  Mode :logical   Mode :logical   Mode :logical   Mode :logical  
    ##  FALSE:4342      FALSE:4342      FALSE:4342      FALSE:4342     
    ##   malform         menarche        mheight          momage       
    ##  Mode :logical   Mode :logical   Mode :logical   Mode :logical  
    ##  FALSE:4342      FALSE:4342      FALSE:4342      FALSE:4342     
    ##    mrace           parity         pnumlbw         pnumsga       
    ##  Mode :logical   Mode :logical   Mode :logical   Mode :logical  
    ##  FALSE:4342      FALSE:4342      FALSE:4342      FALSE:4342     
    ##    ppbmi            ppwt           smoken          wtgain       
    ##  Mode :logical   Mode :logical   Mode :logical   Mode :logical  
    ##  FALSE:4342      FALSE:4342      FALSE:4342      FALSE:4342

As a result, this data frame has 20 variables named, babysex, bhead,
blength, bwt, delwt, fincome, frace, gaweeks, malform, menarche,
mheight, momage, mrace, parity, pnumlbw, pnumsga, ppbmi, ppwt, smoken,
wtgain with total of 4342 observations.

In order to check that this data does not have any missing values, used
`summary(is.na(birth_weight))`. No NA present in this data.

## Regression model for birth weight

A linear regression model for birth weight based on hypothesis created
using `lm()` and named it `birth_weight_fit`. `bwt` was the response and
predictors were `bhead`, `blength`, `delwt`, `gaweeks`, and `wtgain` to
observe how baby’s length, head circumference, gestational age along
with mother’s weight gain and weight at the time of delivery effect
baby’s birth weight.

I hypothesized that the the size of the baby at birth, including length
and head circumference, and the weight of mother in relation to the
gestational age would have an effect on the ultimate weight of the baby
at birth.

``` r
birth_weight_fit = lm(bwt ~ bhead + blength + delwt + gaweeks + wtgain, data = birth_weight)
broom::tidy(birth_weight_fit) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

| term        |     estimate |  std.error |  statistic | p.value |
|:------------|-------------:|-----------:|-----------:|--------:|
| (Intercept) | -6173.556115 | 96.3126630 | -64.099111 |   0e+00 |
| bhead       |   135.199090 |  3.4946420 |  38.687536 |   0e+00 |
| blength     |    78.700757 |  2.0701331 |  38.017244 |   0e+00 |
| delwt       |     1.614934 |  0.2163650 |   7.463935 |   0e+00 |
| gaweeks     |    13.691146 |  1.4907416 |   9.184118 |   0e+00 |
| wtgain      |     2.178634 |  0.4359403 |   4.997552 |   6e-07 |

``` r
left_join(add_residuals(birth_weight, birth_weight_fit),
         add_predictions(birth_weight, birth_weight_fit)) %>%
  select(bwt, gaweeks, wtgain, resid, pred) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = pred, y = resid)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Residual vs Fitted", x = "Prediction", y = "Residual")
```

    ## Joining, by = c("babysex", "bhead", "blength", "bwt", "delwt", "fincome", "frace", "gaweeks", "malform", "menarche", "mheight", "momage", "mrace", "parity", "pnumlbw", "pnumsga", "ppbmi", "ppwt", "smoken", "wtgain")

## Compare 3 Models

Compared the hypothesis driven model from above (called fit) with a
model (called model 1) with length at birth and gestational age as
predictors and another model (called model 2) with head circumference,
length, sex, and all interactions between. Used `crossv_mc()` to compare
in terms of the cross-validated prediction error.

``` r
cv_df = 
  crossv_mc(birth_weight, 100) %>%
  mutate(
    train = map(train, as_tibble),
    test = map(test, as_tibble)) %>%
  mutate(
    fit_model = map(train, ~lm(bwt ~ bhead + blength + delwt + gaweeks + wtgain, data = .x)),
    compare_model_1 = map(train, ~lm(bwt ~ blength + gaweeks, data = .x)),
    compare_model_2 = map(train, ~lm(bwt ~ bhead + blength + babysex + bhead * blength + 
                                       bhead * babysex + blength * babysex, data = .x))) %>%
  mutate(
    rmse_fit = map2_dbl(fit_model, test, ~rmse(model = .x, data = .y)),
    rmse_model_1 = map2_dbl(compare_model_1, test, ~rmse(model = .x, data = .y)),
    rmse_model_2 = map2_dbl(compare_model_2, test, ~rmse(model = .x, data = .y)))

cv_df %>% 
  select(starts_with("rmse")) %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    everything(),
    names_to = "model", 
    values_to = "rmse",
    names_prefix = "rmse_") %>% 
  mutate(model = fct_inorder(model)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = model, y = rmse)) + 
  geom_violin() +
  labs(title = "3 Model Comparison", x = "Model", y = "RMSE")
```

![](p8105_hw6_yo2336_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png)<!-- -->

The model with least amount of predictors (model 1) had generally higher
RMSE distribution when compared with the other 2 models.

# Problem 2

## Load data

Will be focusing on `tmin` and `tmax`.

``` r
weather_df = 
  rnoaa::meteo_pull_monitors(
    c("USW00094728"),
    var = c("PRCP", "TMIN", "TMAX"), 
    date_min = "2017-01-01",
    date_max = "2017-12-31") %>%
  mutate(
    name = recode(id, USW00094728 = "CentralPark_NY"),
    tmin = tmin / 10,
    tmax = tmax / 10) %>%
  select(name, id, everything())
```

    ## Registered S3 method overwritten by 'hoardr':
    ##   method           from
    ##   print.cache_info httr

    ## using cached file: C:\Users\1004y\AppData\Local/Cache/R/noaa_ghcnd/USW00094728.dly

    ## file min/max dates: 1869-01-01 / 2021-10-31

## Bootstrap

Used `bootstrap()` to create 5000 bootstrap samples. These samples were
used to evaluate simple linear regression with `tmax` as the response
and `tmin` as the predictor.

``` r
weather_bootstrap =
  weather_df %>%
  bootstrap(5000)

bootstrap_results =
  weather_bootstrap %>%
  mutate(
    models = map(strap, ~lm(tmax ~ tmin, data = .x)),
    results = map(models, broom::tidy),
    results2 = map(models, broom::glance)) %>%
  unnest(results, results2) %>%
  select(.id, term, estimate, r.squared) %>%
  janitor::clean_names()
```

    ## Warning: unnest() has a new interface. See ?unnest for details.
    ## Try `df %>% unnest(c(results, results2))`, with `mutate()` if needed

## r^2

The r^2 values were extracted directly from `broom::glance` which were
then used to calculate 95% confidence interval.

``` r
bootstrap_results %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = r_squared)) + 
  geom_density() +
  labs(title = "Distribution of r^2")
```

![](p8105_hw6_yo2336_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png)<!-- -->

``` r
bootstrap_results %>%
  summarize(
    ci_lower = quantile(r_squared, 0.025), 
    ci_upper = quantile(r_squared, 0.975)) %>%
  knitr::kable(caption = "95% Confidence Interval for r^2")
```

| ci\_lower | ci\_upper |
|----------:|----------:|
| 0.8934132 | 0.9275987 |

95% Confidence Interval for r^2

The distribution of r^2 resemble a normal distribution.

## log(β\_0∗β\_1)

The log(β\_0∗β\_1) values were calculated from log(`intercept` estimate
\* `tmin` estimate) which were then used to calculate 95% confidence
interval.

``` r
log_results =
  bootstrap_results %>%
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = "term",
    values_from = "estimate"
  ) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  mutate(log = log(intercept * tmin))

log_results %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = log)) + 
  geom_density() +
  labs(title = "Distribution of log(β_0∗β_1)", x = "log(β_0∗β_1)")
```

![](p8105_hw6_yo2336_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png)<!-- -->

``` r
log_results %>%
  summarize(
    ci_lower = quantile(log, 0.025), 
    ci_upper = quantile(log, 0.975)) %>%
  knitr::kable(caption = "95% Confidence Interval for log(β_0∗β_1)")
```

| ci\_lower | ci\_upper |
|----------:|----------:|
|  1.964946 |  2.059812 |

95% Confidence Interval for log(ß\_0\*ß\_1)

The distribution of log(β\_0∗β\_1) resemble a normal distribution
